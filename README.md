# intro-to-R-talks
This repo is a fork from eddjberry which contains two talks that I have modified for myself

Edd originally gave this talk as part of the Perception, Action &amp; Cognition Lab Open Science Week, 2017 (University of Leeds)

The slides themselves can be found in the two `.html` files, with the underlying code in their respective `.Rmd` files.
